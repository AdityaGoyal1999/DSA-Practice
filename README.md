# DSA Practice

Personal repository for revising and tracking Data Structures and Algorithms problems.

## Structure
- **Arrays/**: Array problems organized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- **Linked List/**: Linked List problems organized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- **Trees/**: Binary tree problems organized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Each file contains problem solutions with test cases

## Purpose
This repository serves as my personal practice space for DSA problem-solving and algorithm implementation.
